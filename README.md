# Description

I am a student of the course and this is one of my final works on the module. This module is called SQL and Data Retrieval.

Since I was provided with a sample database for writing queries and I cannot lay out the ports to connect to it remotely.

My work consists of 5 files from the main program and the FinalWork folder where the final work is written where I connect to the PostgreSQL training database.

### Description of files :
* WorkingWithCreateTable
  * In this file, I learned how to work with databases, create primary key fields and composite primary keys.
* WorkingWithExplainAnalyzeJsonArray
  * In this file, I learned how to work with data arrays and JSON objects
* WorkingWithJoinFunctions
  * This file presents working with functions for data enrichment
* WorkingWithTheBasics
  * In this file, I just learned how to write entry-level SQL queries.
* WorkingWithWindowFunction
